# Coursera_Capstone
## Problem and Background
This repository contains my coursera_capstone project from the Applied Data Science course offered by IBM. As my project I chose to predict the 2019/2020 season standing of the NBA, the National Basketball Association. The NBA is the best basketball league in the world and it is a huge business. Being able to predict the season standing before the season starts can help the team, the media and the bet companies to plan better. I especially want to choose a model which will give some insight into what features are the most defining for predicting the season standing. These are the features the team need to look out for. 

## Data
I will get my data from the NBA Api (https://github.com/swar/nba_api). It contains data about every team and player running back to the old days. I can use it to fid the stats of a previous year of a team and players to predict the next years performance. As the feature to predict I chose the winning percentage, which leads to a direct season standing.
